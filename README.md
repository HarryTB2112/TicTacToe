# TicTacToe
## Introduction
This is a beginner Tic Tac Toe game. This is a beginner project used to teach myself fullstack techniques and uses [Zach Gollwitzer's tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=onSGAEanl_Y).

I initially created the game using one main file of Vanilla Javascript, HTML and CSS, I then refactored the Javascript using the MVC pattern with a main, view, and store file. Most recently I refactored the Javascript again using TypeScript to increase project safety. 

## Tech Used
- Vanilla Javascript
- HTML
- CSS
- TypeScript
